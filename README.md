# Binary-Search-Sorted-Array-
Completed the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm using C. This project demonstrates an efficient searching technique based on the divide-and-conquer approach, where a sorted array is repeatedly divided to locate a target element. The program is console-based and designed to highlight performance improvement over linear search.
