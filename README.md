# 🔎 Binary Search (Sorted Array) in C

## 📌 Overview

This project contains the completed implementation of the **Binary Search algorithm** using the C programming language. Binary Search is an efficient searching technique that works on a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search space into halves until the target element is found or the search space becomes empty.

This project is part of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice and focuses on improving my understanding of efficient searching techniques.
